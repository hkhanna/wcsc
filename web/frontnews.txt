Hello Warren!

Warren College Student Council, your representative student government, is all about you. We do things solely for the good of Warren, and it is for this reason I ask you: 

When was the last time you came to a WCSC meeting?

We meet every Thursday at 5PM in JK Wood Lounge (above Canyon Vista Dining Hall). We have a special section of our agenda right at the beginning titled “Student Input” where any student can say whatever they want about anything and have your Council respond or do something about it. 

Having problems with Housing and Dining? We have a Representative just to help for that. Problems living off campus or being a Transfer student? We have Representatives for that. Something wrong with Warren’s Academic Affairs? We have a Representative for that. Just about ANYTHING you have issue with, we have a specific go-to person to help out. 

We’re here for YOU. If you have any questions about anything but don’t want to come to a meeting and don’t know to whom you should direct it, email me at ewward@ucsd.edu and I’ll get it to the right person.

You have the ultimate power, not us. You pay a $4 Activity Fee per quarter that goes to WCSC for events, for programs, and for funding organizations. Want to know where it’s going? Come to a meeting!

Please, please get involved somehow on campus if not directly in Warren. Somewhere on this webpage is a link to a document of how you can even start your OWN club if you don’t want to join a preexisting one. 

Take a look at the picture here, too. This is from our super-fun retreat that came to no cost to Warren students- we paid for it through fundraising! Getting involved is way worth the minimal effort (look how much fun we’re having!).

Watch for posters and flyers about WCSC events, too. We have fun ones like free food events, Broomball, and capture the flag all coming up.

Hit me up with ANY comments or questions! See ya around

Erik Ward  
President, WCSC
