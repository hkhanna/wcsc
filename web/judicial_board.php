<p>The Warren College Judicial Board (WCJB) is vested with the judicial authority of Warren College. It is comprised of nine members appointed to two-year terms. From their own membership, the board elects a Chair and a Vice-Chair. Its constitutional duties are to resolve disputes of constitutionality and parliamentary procedure that arise in WCSC, decide on the removal of impeached WCSC members, adjudicate alleged violations of college and university regulations, and to serve as the elections hearing board for all Warren College elections.
<p>The operations of WCJB are governed by the Bylaws of the Warren College Judicial Board, which are written by the <a href="leg_board.php">Legislative Board</a>. To file a violation of the rules, please submit the Rules Violation Grievance Form to the Warren Dean of Student Affairs' office or to the Chair of the Warren College Judicial Board. If you would like to appeal college or university disciplinary action, please contact the Student Advocate.
